## This is an application to build react apps from reactpractice.dev to enhance my skills in React

1. Build a React application that shows the national holidays for the current year, for a given country.

The main screen should show:

- a dropdown with a list of countries
- a list of public holidays for the selected country
You can retrieve a list of available countries and their holidays from the OpenHolidays API. Use English (en) for the `languageIsoCode`.
- By default, you should show the holidays for The Netherlands.
